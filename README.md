## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on predicting **future electricity demand** using historical consumption data and machine-learning techniques. By analyzing patterns, seasonal behavior, and long-term trends, the system generates forecasts that help stakeholders understand how electricity usage is expected to grow over time.  
Electricity demand prediction plays a crucial role in ensuring stable power supply, reducing blackouts, optimizing energy production, and supporting renewable integration. With accurate forecasts, utility providers can plan infrastructure better, reduce operational costs, and minimize energy wastage.  
The model built here serves as a practical tool for researchers, data scientists, and power companies to make informed decisions, efficiently manage resources, and build smarter, more sustainable energy systems.
